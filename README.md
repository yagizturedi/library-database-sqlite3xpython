# library-database-sqlite3xpython
A library database project that contains a book library and a music library. Created by using Sqlite3 with Python.

To run this python project, you must download all the files in the repository, have Sqlite3 installed in your computer and added to path, and Sqlite3 module of Python added to the directory.

There are three Python files in this repository:
1- Classes.py
2- Library.py
3- SongLibrary.py

You can either run SongLibrary.py or Library.py for database to establish. Classes.py, however, only contains the classes used by other main scripts. The rest is pretty self explanatory.

ENJOY!
